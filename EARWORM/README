This is an implementation of EARWORM, a candidate in the Password
Hashing Competition (https://password-hashing.net). earworm.pdf
contains the submission document.

Typing 'make' will build the binaries test-ref and test-opt, which
when run will output some test vectors and then benchmark the time it
takes to run 16 threads concurrently. test-ref is the reference
implementation; test-opt is the optimized implementation. The
optimized implementation requires AES-NI support but does not check
for it; running it on a CPU that is missing AES-NI will cause it to
crash with an illegal opcode.

Most of the code comprising this implementation is dedicated to the
public domain. The SHA-256 implementation is copyright Colin Percival
and MIT-licensed. See individual file headers for licensing details.
