This is a convenience GIT repos containing the first round
submissions to the Password Hashing Contest.

See https://password-hashing.net/ for details about the competition.

Please see individual files for copyright and licensing.

The submissions have been "sanitized" the following ways:

        CRLF -> LF
        Remove various binary files
        Remove hidden files
        Replace white-space in filenames with underscore
        Use consistent capitaliztion of top level directories

Over time, commits will be made to make life easier for people
who want to play around with the code, for instance by improving
Makefiles or portability.

No substantial or functional changes will be made unless at the
explicit request of the algorithms authors/submitters.

Such requests should be addressed to the PHC panel@ email list.
